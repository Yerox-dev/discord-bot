This is my discordbot coded with discord.py. I took the commands grouped in seperated cogs, the bot is modulbased and the cogs will loaded automaticly, if they are in /cogs.
Before you cna run tthe bot you must create a file with the name "SECRETS.py" in the main directory with a vaiable "TOKEN".
Example:
# SECRETS.py
TOKEN = "TOKEN"
